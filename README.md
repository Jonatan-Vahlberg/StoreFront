# StoreFront
PARTICIPANT: Jonatan Vahlberg

A C#, MVC, HTML, JS AND CSS project Done at the end of first semester in Stockholm Institute of Technology Mobile applications developer

The Project consits of a Storefront for a madeup Store called Delicia Furnitures.
As the name would sugest they sell furnitures to a higher end clientell.

The Guidelines for this project was as follows:

Customer should be bale to register and Login
Customer should be able to add to cart and checkout store wares
Store wares are to be filterd based in part on popularity and part on Customer Prefrence
Customer is a object with properties read from either SQL database or a JSON file

Storefront shall display pertinant poducts to spesific user using user data and global data
Storefront items are saved in a SQL DB or JSON and read from there
storefront consists of categories of some kind
In Storefront you can read more on a product or see multiple

Storeitems are to be of inherited type
Storeitems are objects saved like users

INPROMENTS MADE BY ME

Login system has is more Secured by having password go through salting then SHA252 Hashing
  This protects the system from bruteforce Rainbowtable attacks

Use of constuctors,Enums, Enum flagging, generic and minor abstraction in order to streamline process

Upgraded category sytem filtering on room of use and on type of ware

This has been a learing experience for me and this code is free for anyone to use should they feel so inclined just link back.
